Would you be able to recognise these hazards, and have you done the necessary training to work safely?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even office workers are exposed to risks due to improper use of their display screens. They can put themselves and others at risk by not following correct fire safety procedures. As an employee, if you are able to recognise these hazards, you can protect yourself and your colleagues from harm. You also need to cooperate with your employer who has procedures and policies in place to keep you safe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this course you will learn&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consequences of disregarding health and safety&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The law regarding health and safety&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your employer&amp;rsquo;s responsibility&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your responsibility as an employee&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thinking safe and preventing accidents&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;"
